### Start
Build an virtual machine with 4-core/8G, change its ip address to
`10.15.205.100`, hostname `allinone`. 

```
# cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
# mkdir back
# mv *.repo back
# curl http://10.15.205.2/base.repo>base.repo
# yum makecache
```
Notice the base.repo is the repositories we get from the internet.   

Edit the hostfile for adding the registry item(domain name to ip address).   

```
# vim /etc/hosts
10.15.205.2	mirror.xxxx.com
```
Make sure you public key has been inserted into the
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, then create the directory for deployment:    

```
$ sudo cp -r kismatic_for_1015205 allinone
$ cd allinone
$ sudo rm -rf generated*
```

### Configuration

### helm
helm, translation for chinese: `èˆµ`.    

Get started with helm:    

```
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh
# chmod 777 get_helm.sh 
# ./get_helm.sh 
[root@allinone ~]# which helm
/usr/local/bin/helm
[root@allinone ~]# helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.7.2", GitCommit:"8478fb4fc723885b155c924d1c8c410b7a9444e6", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Error: cannot connect to Tiller
```
This error message is because my k8s cluster is not stable. so re-install a
new one. 

### Ubuntu ways
For syncing the packages from the internet, then create a gpg key for
publishing the repository:    

```
# apt-get install -y haveged
# gpg --gen-key

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

# aptly serve
Serving published repositories, recommended apt sources list:

# ./xenial [amd64, arm64, armhf, i386] publishes {main: [xenial-repo]: Merged from sources: 'ubuntu-main', 'gluster', 'docker'}
deb http://vagrant:8080/ xenial main

Starting web server at: :8080 (press Ctrl+C to quit)...
```
Added it to systemd files:    

```
# cat /etc/systemd/system/aptly.service 
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/aptly -config /home/vagrant/.aptly.conf serve -listen=:80
User=root
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable aptly
# systemctl start aptly
```
Failed, why aptly could not be run. 

Client usage:   

```
# sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin yes
# vim /etc/network/interfaces
Change ip addresss
```


```
First in server, export keys:   

    # gpg --export --armor >mypublic.pub
    # cat mypublic.pub 
    # scp mypublic.pub  root@10.15.205.200:/root/

Then in clients import the keys:    


        # cat mypublic.pub |apt-key add -
        OK
        root@ubuntu:/root# apt-key list
        /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
```

Then `sudo apt-get update` won't get any errors.   

Thus you could have a server at the certain vm, convert this vm from
virtualbox into qcow2 via following command.    

```
# qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 box-disk001.vmdk aptly_ubuntu.qcow2
```

Start the registry server.    

Create a new ubuntu server, enable the sshd login of root. Add repository, add
following definition of the registry:    

```
# vim /etc/hosts
10.15.205.2	mirror.xxxxx.com
```

Then add the kismaticuser.key.pub into the server's
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
